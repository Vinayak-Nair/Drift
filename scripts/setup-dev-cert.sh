# Creates a self-signed "Drift Dev" code-signing certificate in the login
# keychain (idempotent). Signing every local build with this stable identity
# keeps the macOS Accessibility grant (needed for the global push-to-talk hotkey)
# from being invalidated on every rebuild — which is what happens with the
# default ad-hoc signing, since each ad-hoc build gets a fresh signature.
#
# No Apple Developer account needed. The cert is untrusted as a root, which is
# fine: codesign still signs with it, and the app's designated requirement
# becomes cert-based (stable) instead of build-hash-based.

# Run once:  ./scripts/setup-dev-cert.sh
