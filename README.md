# Drift

**Local-first voice dictation for macOS. A free, open-source alternative to Wispr Flow.**

Hold a key, speak, and Drift types cleaned-up text into whatever app you're using. English transcription runs entirely on your Mac with [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio); [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) and AI4Bharat IndicConformer are available for multilingual and Indic-language dictation.

- 🎙️ **Push-to-talk anywhere**, system-wide
- 🔒 **Private by default**: on-device transcription and on-device cleanup, no account, no API key
- 🇬🇧 **English-first right now**, using FluidAudio's local Parakeet model for fast dictation
- 🌐 **Multilingual optional**, via WhisperKit or AI4Bharat IndicConformer for Indian-language transcription
- 🧹 **Smart cleanup**: removes filler words and fixes punctuation instantly on-device; optional cloud or local LLM cleanup for higher quality
- 🪶 **Native and lightweight**: a Swift menu-bar app, no Electron
- 🆓 **MIT licensed**

## Install (for users)

1. Download `Drift.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/) page.
2. Open it and drag **Drift** to your Applications folder.
3. Open Drift. A small waveform icon appears in your menu bar.
4. Follow the one-time setup: grant **Microphone** and **Accessibility**, and let the speech model download.
5. Click into any text field, **hold Right Option (⌥)**, speak, and release.

No Homebrew, no Terminal, no separate downloads. Everything is handled inside the app.

> Accessibility is required so Drift can detect the push-to-talk key and type into other apps. You can review this anytime in the menu under **Setup & Permissions**.

## Using Drift

- **Dictate:** hold Right Option (⌥), speak, release. The text is inserted at your cursor.
- **Change language:** menu bar ▸ Language, or Settings.
- **Pick a cleanup style:** Settings ▸ Cleanup.
- Sounds confirm start, success, and empty results.

## Languages

Drift currently defaults to **FluidAudio English** using Parakeet TDT v3.

In Settings you can switch the dictation model to:

- **WhisperKit Multilingual** for English plus Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, and others.
- **AI4Bharat IndicConformer** for the 22 official Indian languages supported by `ai4bharat/indic-conformer-600m-multilingual`: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Kashmiri, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.

IndicConformer is experimental in Drift. It runs through a local Python worker because the Hugging Face model uses custom Python/ONNX code rather than WhisperKit/Core ML.

### AI4Bharat IndicConformer setup

The model repository is gated on Hugging Face, so you must accept access once before Drift can download it.

```bash
./scripts/setup-indic-conformer.sh
```

Then:

1. Open [ai4bharat/indic-conformer-600m-multilingual](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indic-conformer-600m-multilingual) and accept the access conditions.
2. Run `.venv-indic-conformer/bin/huggingface-cli login`.
3. In Drift Settings, pick **AI4Bharat IndicConformer** and set **Python path** to the absolute path printed by the setup script.

The first transcription can take a while because the 600M model downloads and loads into the worker. Subsequent dictations reuse the same local worker while Drift is running.

## Cleanup options

| Provider | Where it runs | Setup | Best for |
|----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **On-device** (default) | Your Mac | None | Instant, private formatting |
| **Cloud (OpenAI-compatible)** | A hosted API | Base URL + key | Highest quality; works with OpenAI, Groq, **Sarvam**, LM Studio |
| **Local LLM (Ollama)** | Your Mac | Run Ollama | Private LLM cleanup, advanced |
| **Raw** | n/a | None | Insert the transcription verbatim |

The cleanup layer is model-agnostic, so adding an Indian-language model such as Sarvam is just a base URL and model name in Settings.

## Privacy

By default, audio is transcribed on-device and cleaned on-device. Nothing is uploaded. If you opt into a cloud cleanup provider, only the transcribed text (not your audio) is sent to the endpoint you configure.

## Building from source (for contributors)

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- **Full Xcode 16+** (Command Line Tools alone are not enough: WhisperKit and the app build need Xcode). If your internal disk is low, Xcode and its build data can live on an external APFS SSD.
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (the bootstrap script installs it via Homebrew)

### Steps

```bash
git clone <repo-url> Drift && cd Drift
./scripts/bootstrap.sh     # installs XcodeGen, generates the project, resolves deps
open Drift.xcodeproj       # then press Run (Cmd+R)
```

Run the core unit tests with:

```bash
swift test
```

### Push-to-talk permission across rebuilds

The global push-to-talk hotkey needs macOS **Accessibility** permission, which is
tied to the app's code signature. Default ad-hoc signing changes the signature on
every rebuild, so the grant is invalidated each time and the hotkey "stops
working." To make it stick, sign local builds with a stable self-signed identity:

```bash
./scripts/setup-dev-cert.sh   # one-time: creates a "Drift Dev" code-signing cert
./scripts/dev-run.sh          # build + sign + relaunch (use this instead of Cmd+R)
```

Grant Accessibility to Drift once after the first signed build; it then persists
across all future `dev-run.sh` rebuilds (the signature, hence the permission, no
longer changes). No Apple Developer account required.

### Project layout

`DriftKit` is a pure, testable Swift package (no UI). The macOS app in `Sources/DriftApp` is generated into an Xcode project by XcodeGen from `project.yml`.

| Area | Path | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| Core | `Sources/DriftKit/Pipeline.swift` | record ▸ transcribe ▸ clean orchestration |
| STT | `Sources/DriftKit/Transcription/` | `Transcriber` protocol, FluidAudio + WhisperKit + IndicConformer impls, model download/worker bridge |
| Cleanup | `Sources/DriftKit/Cleanup/` | `CleanupProvider` protocol + deterministic / OpenAI-compatible / Ollama |
| Audio | `Sources/DriftKit/Audio/Recorder.swift` | mic capture to 16 kHz samples |
| App | `Sources/DriftApp/` | menu bar, onboarding, settings, hotkey, paste |

### Releasing

```bash
DEV_ID="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
NOTARY_PROFILE="drift-notary" \
./scripts/release.sh
```

Produces a signed, notarized `build/Drift.dmg`. Notarization needs a paid Apple Developer account; without one the script still builds an ad-hoc-signed DMG for local use.

The release bundles the default English model (Parakeet v3, ~470 MB) inside the app so first-run dictation works instantly with no download. It's copied from your local model cache (`~/Library/Application Support/Drift/models/FluidAudio/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`) — run the app once to populate it, or set `MODEL_CACHE` to a directory containing that folder. If no model is found, the DMG ships without one and users download it on first run (the previous behavior). The model is never committed to git. Multilingual Whisper models download on demand. IndicConformer downloads through the user's local Hugging Face/Python environment after access is accepted.

### Automated releases (CI)

Pushing a tag that starts with `v` builds and publishes a GitHub Release automatically — no local build needed (see [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)):

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

On a macOS GitHub runner the workflow archives the app, downloads and bundles the Parakeet v3 model, builds an ad-hoc-signed `Drift.dmg`, and attaches it to a `v0.2.0` release marked **latest** — so the landing page's download link always resolves to the newest build. It sets the app's version from the tag and needs no Apple Developer account. To ship a notarized build instead, add `DEV_ID` / notary credentials as repository secrets and wire them into the build step (the script already honors `DEV_ID` and `NOTARY_PROFILE`). You can also trigger it manually from **Actions ▸ Release ▸ Run workflow**.

## Roadmap

- [ ] App icon and a polished menu-bar status UI
- [ ] Move the API key to the Keychain
- [ ] Live partial-transcription overlay
- [ ] Custom vocabulary and per-app formatting profiles
